# ARC9 BOCW Shared Content

Various weapons and attachments on BOCW sometimes share the same materials. Best examples of this case are bullets and handle attachments. This repo consists of shared code, sounds, textures and materials used mutually by different weapons.

Notice! Pistols will be released soon to the workshop. This(Shared Content), Attachments Pack, and Camo Packs will also be released simultaneously. Until then you have to clone this repository in order to not have missing textures, materials and sounds.

# You need to clone this repository alongside ARC-9 BOCW to your addons folder if you plan to download this weapon pack from GitHub.
