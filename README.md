# ARC9 BOCW Attachments

Here are universal attachments featured in BOCW used for customizing multiple or all weapons. The same optics, muzzles and body(tactical) attachments are used in almost all weapons in game. This repository is dedicated to the Attachments aspect of BOCW.

There are two use cases for this pack:

1. You use the cold war weapons and want to have attachments to further customize the weapons.
2. You don't use the cold war weapons but would like to have access to some of its attachments like scopes.
